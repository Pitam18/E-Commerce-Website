ABSTRACT: In day to day life, we will need to buy lots of goods or products from ashop. It may be food items, electronic items, house hold items etc etc. Now a days, it is really hard to get some time to go out and get them by ourselves due to busy life styleor lots of works. In order to solve this,E-Commerce websites have been started.Using these websites, we can buy goods or products online just by visiting the website and ordering the item online by making payments online.This existing system of buying goods has several disadvantages. It requires lots of time to travel to the particular shop to buy the goods. Since everyone is leading busy life now a days, time means a lot to everyone. Also there are expensesfor travelling from house to shop. More over the shop from where we would like to buy some thing may not be open 24*7*365. Hence we have to adjust our time with
the shopkeeper’s time or vendor’s time.
 In order to overcome these, we have e-commerce solution, i.e one placewhere we can get all required goods/products online. The proposed system helps inbuilding a website to buy, sell products or goods online using internet connection.Purchasing of goods online, user can choose different products based on categories ,online payments , delivery services and hence covering the disadvantages<br><br>
